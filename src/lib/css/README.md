#CSS

The CSS folder will contain the CSS for the site.  If Sass (or other preprocessor) is used, it should be a subfolder of the CSS folder.  Any font files served locally should be stored in the fonts subfolder.

File Structure:

    css
      |-fonts
      |-scss
          |-base
          |-pages
          |-partials
          |-modules
          |-vendors
