#JavaScript

All site JavaScript should be in the JavaScript folder.  Create subfolders as needed to properly organize JavaScript.  The exception would be JavaScript for Single Page Apps, like an Angular app, which has it's own recommended folder location and structure (see https://github.com/EnlightenAgency/reStart-angular).
